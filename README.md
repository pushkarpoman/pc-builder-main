## Overview

This is a PC Builder website developed using Next.js, a React framework. The website allows users to browse and select PC components to build their own custom PC. It includes features like a Home page displaying featured products, category sections, product detail pages, and a PC Builder tool. The PC Builder page is a protected route accessible only to logged-in users, and user authentication is implemented using NextAuth with social login providers like Google/Github.
